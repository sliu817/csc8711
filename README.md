##This firebase application is a simple “Movie Review in One Sentence” website.
Basically, home page will show several movie genres, each genre is linked to a
movie list page which shows all the movies in this genre, and each movie is linked
to a writing review page. This page will also present tens of recently reviews about
this movie. All these complete the search and display functions.

##Also, there will have add and delete functions for administrators, such as adding
genres, movies and reviews or deleting, update them.

##The “writing review” page is kind of like simple comment or sharing system. Since
firebase is a real-time database and is designed for collaborative applications, then
this review page will not only provide a text area for writing data for all the users,
but also display recently comment data for sharing their ideas. Further, we will use
firebase security rules to secure these actions.
